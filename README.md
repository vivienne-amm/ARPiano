# Augmented Reality Strategies for Piano Education

## Remote Piano Lessons & Piano Theory Hub 
AR Piano is an interactive augmented reality (AR) application for remote piano learning and music theory education. The findings of two user studies indicate positive outcomes in terms of user engagement and skill
improvement. A selection of features is presented below. 

### Teacher Student Positioning

*(A) The teacher plays a melody that the student tries to replicate by observing the highlighting of the keys. (B) The teacher is placed next to the student and can provide feedback e.g. on hand positioning, fingering, and dynamics, while the student plays the piano.(C) The positioning opposite of each other facilitates conversation and allows for the use of non-verbal communication and gesture, e.g. to explain theoretical concepts.*

### Music Theory Hub for in between lessons
The Music Theory Hub contains exercises on Notes and Keys, Intervals, Scales, and Chords.

*(A) Users can practice recognizing keys given by their note names. Optionally, the note names can be displayed directly over the virtual keyboard while practicing. Feedback is given by illuminating the keys green or red, by a sound effecr and by feedback on the screen. (B) Chord Exercise: The number of semitones between the notes of the chord is indicated on
the keys to facilitate comprehension of how chord types follow specific patterns of semitone distance.*

### Interactive Theory Area

*(A) The Theory Area can be used by the teacher for interactive music theory exercises and explanations. (B, C) Teachers and students can interact collaboratively with the objects in the Theory Area.*

### Visibility Options
Users can toggle virtual hand and piano visibility based on their preferences.
